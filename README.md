### PREVIOUSLY USED PLUGINS

* `w0rp/ale` : using `coc.nvim` now, which has a better LSP support.

### KNOWN ISSUES

* when using airblade/vim-rooter: Changes Vim working directory to project root.( https://github.com/airblade/vim-rooter ) - doesn't work well with nerdtree because it unsets `autochdir` and because of that, I can't open NerdTree in the VCS root on vim start.

### TODO
right now there's an attempt to make the config compatible with both vim and neovim.
I might want to move completely to neovim and put vim config in archive mode or
maybe i'll restructure my config to include vim, neovim and vscode.
I've not made up my mind fully on that.

as of aug 2023, after Bram Moolenaar's passing, there's no clear directive of vim.
vim was already an improvement over vi and neovim is over vim.

neovim has tree-sitter support, native lua support, client-server architecture, community driven,
better out-of-the-box config, and several other optimisations and cleaner codebase
(e.g. they removed cscope support in nvim 0.9+ ), it has an inbuilt library 'Checkhealth' to see 
if everything's installed properly or not. You can embed nvim into other editors, no more half-baked
vim emulations and more work is being done on this. the nvim code is being refactored to move away
from vimscript one part at a time and it's a fast moving project.

nvim was moving ahead of vim development in terms of new features. it has more robust async support (RPC API),
native lsp and dap support, embedded terminal support, floating windows etc. each of which eventually found its ways to
vim but, apparantly nvim does them better.
