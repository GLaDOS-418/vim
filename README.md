### KNOWN ISSUES
* when using airblade/vim-rooter: Changes Vim working directory to project root.( https://github.com/airblade/vim-rooter ) - doesn't work well with nerdtree because it unsets `autochdir` and because of that, I can't open NerdTree in the VCS root on vim start.

### TODO
right now there's an attempt to keep the config compatible with both vim and neovim.
Although, I might move completely to neovim and put vim config in archive mode or
maybe i'll restructure my config to separate vim/neovim/vscode-nvim config.

As of Aug 2023, after Bram Moolenaar's passing, [vim's future](https://github.com/vim/vim/discussions/12736) is yet to be seen.
vim was already an improvement over vi and neovim is an attempt to improve upon that.

neovim has tree-sitter support, native lua support, more exclusive plugins, client-server architecture, community driven,
better out-of-the-box config, several other optimisations (e.g. [better file change detection](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1380)
(you can use [this workaround](https://github.com/GLaDOS-418/vim/blob/ea23b01022f56358030163471ed2f484ad9d4407/vimrc#L430) ) ),
it has an inbuilt library 'Checkhealth' to see if everything's installed properly or not.

You can embed nvim into other editors (e.g. [vscode-neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim), [firenvim](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim) ),
no more half-baked vim emulations and more work is being done on this and more. the nvim code is being refactored to move away
from vimscript one part at a time to lua and it's a fast moving project.

nvim was moving ahead of vim development in terms of new features. it has more robust async support (RPC API),
native lsp support and a better dap support, embedded terminal support, floating windows etc.
a few of which eventually found its ways to vim but, apparently nvim does them better.
